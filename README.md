## CIFAR10 Training

### Task Description

We evaluate image classification performance on the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

For training, we have two metrics:
- **Training Time:** Train an image classification model for the CIFAR10 dataset. Report the time needed to train
  a model with test set accuracy of at least 94%
- **Cost:** On public cloud infrastructure, compute the total time needed to reach a test set accuracy of
  94% or greater, as outlined above. Multiply the time taken (in hours) by the cost of the instance per hour, to obtain the
  total cost of training the model

Including cost is optional and will only be calculated if the `costPerHour` field is included in the JSON file.
Submissions that only aim for time aren't restricted to public cloud infrastructure.

### JSON Format

Results for the CIFAR10 training tasks can be reported using a JSON file with the following fields,

- `version`: DAWNBench competition version (currently v1.0)
- `author`: Author name
- `authorEmail`: Author email
- `framework`: Framework on which training / inference was performed
- `codeURL`: [Optional] URL pointing to code for model
- `model`: Model name
- `hardware`: A short description of the hardware on which model training was performed. If relevant,
  please specify Cloud provider and instance type to make results more reproducible
- `costPerHour`: [Optional] Reported in USD ($). Cost of instance per hour
- `timestamp`: Date of submission in format `yyyy-mm-dd`
- `logFilename`: [Optional] URL pointing to training logs
- `misc`: [Optional] JSON object of other miscellaneous notes, such as learning rate schedule, optimization algorithm,
  framework version, etc.

In addition, report training progress at the end of every epoch in a TSV with the following format,

```epoch\thours\ttop1Accuracy```

We will compute time to reach a test set accuracy of 94% by reading off the first entry in the above TSV
with a top-1 test set accuracy of at least 94%.

JSON and TSV files are named `[author name]_[model name]_[hardware tag]_[framework].json`, similar to
`dawn_resnet56_1k80-gc_tensorflow.[json|tsv]`. Put the JSON and TSV files in the `CIFAR10/train/` sub-directory.

## CIFAR10 Inference

### Task Description

We evaluate image classification performance on the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

For inference, we have two metrics:
- **Latency:** Use a model that has a test set accuracy of 94% or greater. Measure the total time needed to classify
  all 10,000 images in the CIFAR10 test set _one-at-a-time_, and then divide by 10,000
- **Cost:** Use a model that has a test set accuracy of 94% or greater. Measure the average per-image latency
  in the CIFAR10 test set, and then multiply by the cost of the instance per unit time

### JSON Format

Results for the CIFAR10 inference tasks can be reported using a JSON file with the following fields,

- `version`: DAWNBench competition version (currently v1.0)
- `author`: Author name
- `authorEmail`: Author email
- `framework`: Framework on which training / inference was performed
- `codeURL`: [Optional] URL pointing to code for model
- `model`: Model name
- `hardware`: A short description of the hardware on which model inference was performed. If relevant,
  please specify Cloud provider and instance type to make results more reproducible
- `latency`: Reported in milliseconds. Time needed to classify one image
- `cost`: Reported in USD ($). Cost of performing inference on a single image. Computed as `costPerHour * latency`
- `top1Accuracy`: Reported in percentage points from 0 to 100. Accuracy of model on CIFAR10 test dataset.
- `timestamp`: Date of submission in format `yyyy-mm-dd`
- `logFilename`: [Optional] URL pointing to training / inference logs
- `misc`: [Optional] JSON object of other miscellaneous notes, such as batch size, framework version,
  etc.
  
Note that it is only necessary to specify _one_ of the `latency` and `cost` fields outlined
above. However, it is encouraged to specify both (if available) in a single JSON result file.

JSON files are named `[author name]_[model name]_[hardware tag]_[framework].json`, similar to
`dawn_resnet56_1k80-gc_tensorflow.json`. Put the JSON file in the `CIFAR10/inference/` sub-directory.

## FAQ
- **Can spot instances be used for cost metrics?** For submissions including cost, please use on-demand, i.e., non-preemptible, instance pricing. Spot pricing is too volatile for the current release the benchmark. We're open to suggestions on better ways to deal with pricing volatility, so if you have ideas, please pitch them on the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dawn-bench-community)
- **Is validation time included in training time?** No, you don't need to include the time required to calculate validation accuracy and save checkpoints.
